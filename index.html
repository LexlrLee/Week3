        <p>My aim is to visualise Chinese characters in Chinese and to make this Chinese character evolution comprehensible to English speakers. 
        As Chinese characters themselves are derived from pictographs, they are also written figuratively, through some kind of imagery. 
        This week's focus is on collecting these characters and putting together a complete JSON file for visualisation next week.
